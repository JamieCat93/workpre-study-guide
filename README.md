# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My Movitation was to keep all notes together in one place while I am in bootcamp and to have for my future career. TO have all of my notes readily available, this creates a structured enviorment to have during the learning period and beyond. This project solves the problem of having notes in one place, I can come back to one area whenever I have a question/ am stuck or can come back here to study. I learned how to create a website from botom up, before this I had no idea how to make anything. Now i understand all it takes and how to build, fix issues and see potential bugs
